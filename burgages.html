            <h2 class="topicHeader">What is a burgage?</h2>
            <p>A 'burgage' is the name for a typically long, narrow plot of land found behind medieval town houses in Enland. The origin and function of this plot of land is described in short paper by Slater 1981 [1]:</p>
            <blockquote>Burgages are the basic 'cells' in any analysis of medieval town plans. They are characteristically long and narrow and are arranged in series along the streets.</blockquote>
            <p>Slater continues shortly after:</p>
            <blockquote>The essence of the medieval borough was that labour and other services due to the lord had been commuted to an annual fixed money rent - the borough render, or <i>firma burgi</i>. This was levied upon particular townspeople - the burgesses - who might ultimately aspire to become a self-governing community under a charter of Incorporation. A man became a burgess through the freehold of a plot of land - the burgage.</blockquote>
            <p>A few interesting aspects of this I think are worth bearing in mind are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Status and rights in a town, as with everywhere else in medieval times (e.g. think knights/barons/dukes etc.), was closely linked to land ownership.</li>
                <li>Incorporation is something we come across often when discussing industrialisation (e.g. 'Manchester Corporation' can be seen stamped all over the manhole covers of streets in the city), but clearly even in medieval times such a process where people unified under a corporation was legitimate. Reference [2] may be of interest to readers on this point.</li>
                <li>When we think of taxes, rents and other costs of life, we always assume it's paid with money. Of course, in medieval times, the majority of Europeans were peasants without land. They would not have paid in money but in kind (e.g. the 'food rent', tithes and labour). It's just as well we no longer do this as most of us are not involved in food production for a lord (arguably a good thing) and most of England is not owned by the majority of us anyway (possibly not such a good thing - see the book "Who owns England?" [3]).</li>
                <li>'Bourgeoisie' is the term that is associated nowadays with middle-class townsfolk with social status and comfortable levels of wealth. The origin of the terms comes from the Latin/Old French for a town (Burgeis) according to Wikipedia, just as the term 'burgage' and 'borough'. It's all linked to towns. However, it's worth not getting confused with Germanic words that are related to 'Burg' (fortress) and 'Berg' (mountain) - a mistake I have made frequently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>...but I digress! In the analysis by Slater, the size of burgages varies considerably but we are talking around 10m x 25m in Altrincham. This is similar to a modern full-size allotment. You would never have been able to grow absolutely everything for a family on such a plot of land. There would probably <i>not</i> be enough space for:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Larger animals (e.g. pigs and cows, although I wonder if the wealthier "burgesses" had horses and if so where they were kept?)</li>
                <li>Significant amounts of fruit trees - perhaps one or two partly for ornamental reasons, but trees take up a lot of space because they're, errmmm... trees.</li>
                <li>Staple crops like wheat. Presumably, the town would get its wheat and other grains in bulk from large farms.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In summary, we have identified an approximate area of land with some historical precedent (burgages were maintained for centuries) which a family home could use to produce a good deal of the herbs, berries, vegetables and eggs they needed throughout the year without the labour being so unmanageable as to be unable to also have a full time job. The youtube video by Huw Richards: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2uqtWz3b5A">The Economics of Growing your own Food</a> [4] goes further by demonstrating what he thinks could be achieved with a half-plot allotment size. This half-plot is an area of 125m<sup>2</sup> [5], so around half the size of one of these burgages.</p>
            </p>
            <h2 class="topicHeader">A calculation for Manchester's population</h2>
            <p>Suppose a half-plot allotment is required to produce the herbs and vegetables (barring the most basic bulk crops also known as 'fillers') for a healthy family of four all year round with some good planning and crop rotation. . There are 552,000 people in manchester as of 2019 [6], so the amount of land needed for every person to enjoy this level of self-sufficiency would be just over 69 million square meters, or 69km<sup>2</sup>. For context, Greater Manchester is about 1276km<sup>2</sup>, Salford is 21km<sup>2</sup>. If you took the area between Worsley, Leigh, Risley and Urmston as a rough wedge of green land on the Mersey flood plain, this would be about the right size. It's not as much land as I initially thought, and bear in mind we already have allotments in Manchester and a lot of houses have gardens, there are parks and green-belt areas etc.</p>
            <p>In summary, it's a bit of a winding thought process but, if you consider the rough area of land a family might need to ensure they can produce a significant proportion of the vegetables they need for a healthy lifestyle, the amount of land is not as great as I initially thought, and definitely on the scale of a city like Manchester, or any other town in England.</p>
            <p>Note: if the whole of the UK (67 million people) wanted their patch of 125m<sup>2</sup>, we'd need to reserve 8375km<sup>2</sup> for gardens. The UK is 244,376km<sup>2</sup>, so this equates to about 3.4% of the total surface area of the country. When I did this thought experiment, I genuinely thought for such a "small" island with a large population, the percentage of land would be far more. Bearing in mind the majority of housing in England seems to come with some kind of garden anyway and assuming people would rather have some more varied and fresher veg to eat and not a sixth runway in their back yard for a two ton SUV, this level of self-sufficiency seems achievable. Just as one final comparison, about 11% of the UK is reserved for National Parks.</p>
